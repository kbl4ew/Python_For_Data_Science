      "In this problem, we'll explore the very basics of audio compression in the spectral domain using numpy and scipy. We'll do a bit of visualization with matplotlib, but since that is covered later in the course, we'll provide those functions for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audio compression is a large and complex topic, and the design of a format for compressed audio such as the popular [MP3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3) is too complex to cover in detail here. However, we will introduce the basic tools that most such compression formats use, namely:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Converting the input signal to the frequency domain by taking a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Dropping information in the frequency domain, resulting in a smaller amount of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Reconstructing back the signal in the time domain from this smaller representation of the signal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps 1 and 2 above are the 'encoding' part of signal compression, and step 3 is the 'decoding' part. For this reason, the tools that perform these steps are typically referred to as signal 'codecs', short for encoders/decoders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that here we say 'signal': while MP3 is an audio format, the same ideas apply to the compression of digital images with formats such as JPEG and video.  Virtually all multimedia technologies we use today, from audio players to cell phones, digital cameras and YouTubeVideo, are based on sophisticated extensions and applications of these simple ideas."
