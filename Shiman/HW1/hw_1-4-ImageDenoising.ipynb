The FFT output in the `numpy.fft` module is packed with the lower freqeuencies starting in the upper left, and proceeding to higher frequencies as one moves to the center of the spectrum (this is the most efficient way numerically to fill the output of the FFT algorithm).  Because the input signal is real, the output spectrum is complex and symmetrical: the transformation values beyond the midpoint of the frequency spectrum (the Nyquist frequency) correspond to the values for negative frequencies and are simply the mirror image of the positive frequencies below the Nyquist (this is true for the 1D, 2D and ND FFTs in `numpy`).\n",

This is due to the fact that the power spectrum has a small number of pixels with extremely high amplitude, which completely swamp the contrast (you can verify this by playing with a histogram of the data)."
