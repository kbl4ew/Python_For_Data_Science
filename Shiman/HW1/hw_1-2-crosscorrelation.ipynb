      "Obtaining several snapshots of the same scene, from microscopes to telescopes, is useful for the postprocessing increase of signal to noise: by summing up imaging data we can effectively beat down the noise. Interestingly, if we image the same scene from different vistas we can also improve the clarity of the combined image. Being able to discern features in a scene from this combination effort is sometimes called super-resolution imaging.\n",
